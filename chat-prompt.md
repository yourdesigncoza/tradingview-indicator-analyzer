This prompt template is designed to systematically analyze and evaluate trading indicators from platforms like TradingView. It serves several key purposes:

Structured Analysis: Creates a standardized framework to evaluate trading indicators across 5 main categories:
Technical functionality
Usage guidelines
Community feedback
Additional insights
Quantitative rating
Due Diligence: Helps traders make informed decisions by requiring comprehensive review of:
How the indicator actually works
Real user experiences (both positive and negative)
Potential limitations and issues
Practical application scenarios
Quality Assessment: Implements a numerical rating system (1-10) for:
Profitability potential
Technical reliability
This template ensures consistent, thorough evaluation of trading indicators before potential implementation in a trading strategy.

Great, I want you to createa python script that can scrape Tradingview pages eg. ( https://www.tradingview.com/script/56tr3OzQ-Big-Snapper-Alerts-R2-0-by-JustUncleL/ ) then summarise the script using my prompt in the notes.txt file ::: I'm not sure what the best way is to add the URL's I want scraped, maybe from a .csv file might be the best option , I then want to write the rresults into a local ( lite ) database ::: Give me your thoughts

Augment
I'll outline a solution using Python that combines web scraping, prompt-based analysis, and local storage. Here's a proposed structure:

And here's the structure for the CSV file:

Key features of this solution:

Data Input: Uses CSV file for easy URL management
Database: SQLite for lightweight, portable storage
Scraping: Uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
Structure: Object-oriented design for maintainability
Important considerations:

Legal/Terms of Service: Check TradingView's terms regarding scraping
Rate Limiting: You'll need to add delays between requests
Authentication: Some indicators might require login
Analysis Logic: The analyze_indicator method needs to be expanded to implement your prompt's analysis structure
Error Handling: Add more robust error handling and logging
Next steps:

Implement proper rate limiting
Add user authentication if needed
Expand the analysis logic using NLP or AI to generate structured summaries
Add error logging and retry mechanisms
Add data validation and cleaning
Consider adding a simple UI for viewing results
Would you like me to expand on any of these aspects?

Implement proper rate limiting
I agree
Add user authentication if needed
Not needed
Expand the analysis logic using NLP or AI to generate structured summaries
We can use OpenAi I'm prettu sure mini-03 will suffice
Add error logging and retry mechanisms
I agree
Add data validation and cleaning
I agree
Consider adding a simple UI for viewing results
I agree, maybe we can use streamlit

Augment
I'll enhance the code with these requirements. Let's break this into modules for better organization:

scraper

Key improvements:

Rate Limiting: Implemented a decorator-based rate limiter
OpenAI Integration: Added GPT-3.5-turbo for analysis
Data Validation: Using Pydantic models
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging system
UI: Streamlit-based dashboard with metrics and charts
To run this:

Install requirements:
Set up environment variables:
Run the Streamlit app:
Would you like me to:

Add retry mechanisms for failed requests?
Expand the OpenAI prompt engineering?
Add more UI features?
Add data export capabilities?
We should also use .env file for my credentials & I will need to add this to my GIT repository, excited lets develop this 

Augment
I'll help you set up the project with proper environment management and Git structure.

First, let's create a proper project structure and essential files:

To get started with development:

First, create the .env file:
Edit .env with your actual credentials
Create the virtual environment and install dependencies:
Initialize Git repository:
Create necessary directories:
Would you like me to:

Add database integration for storing analysis results?
Create test files for the main components?
Add CI/CD configuration?
Implement more detailed error handling?
Add database integration for storing analysis results?
Yes
Create test files for the main components?
Good
Add CI/CD configuration?
What is this

Augment
Let me explain CI/CD first:

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is an automated way to:

Run tests when you push code
Check code quality
Automatically deploy your application
Ensure your code works across different environments
Let's start with the database integration and tests first, then I can explain CI/CD further if you're interested.

First, let's add SQLAlchemy for database management:

streamlit==1.24.0
openai==0.27.8
pandas==2.0.3
requests==2.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
pydantic==2.0.3
python-decouple==3.8
sqlalchemy==2.0.19
alembic==1.11.1

database
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, JSON
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from datetime import datetime

Base = declarative_base()

class Indicator(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'indicators'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

database
Now let's add database migrations using Alembic:

Let's add some tests:

tests
tests
Update the config to include database settings:

To initialize the database:

Create migration:
Apply migration:
To run tests:

Would you like me to:

Add more test cases?
Explain and implement CI/CD configuration?
Add database backup functionality?
Add more database utilities (like search, filtering)?
Implement CI/CD configuration?
Yes
Add database backup functionality?
Yes
Add more database utilities (like search, filtering)?
Yes

Augment
I'll implement all three. Let's start with CI/CD using GitHub Actions:

.github/workflows
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:

Now let's add database backup functionality:

database
import os
import gzip
import shutil
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime
import boto3
from config import settings
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Now let's add advanced database utilities:

database
Update the config to include backup settings:

To use these new features:

For CI/CD:
Push your code to GitHub
Set up secrets in GitHub repository settings
The pipeline will automatically run tests and deploy
For backups:
For advanced queries:
Would you like me to:

Add scheduled backup functionality using APScheduler?
Add more advanced search features (like fuzzy matching)?
Add monitoring and alerting for the backup process?
Create a backup management interface?
Lets backup database locally, simple dump

Augment
I'll create a simple local database backup script focused on PostgreSQL dumps:

scripts
import os
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime
import logging
from pathlib import Path

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class LocalDatabaseBackup:

Add environment variables:

DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
Usage:

Run backup manually:
Or in your code:
from scripts.backup_db import LocalDatabaseBackup

# Create backup
backup = LocalDatabaseBackup()
backup_path = backup.create_backup()

# List available backups
backups = backup.list_backups()
print("Available backups:", backups)


This script:

Creates timestamped backups in a backups directory
Uses pg_dump for backup and psql for restore
Includes logging for monitoring the process
Provides cleanup functionality to manage disk space
Handles basic error cases
Make sure you have PostgreSQL client tools (pg_dump and psql) installed on your system and the database user has sufficient permissions for backup operations.

Would you like me to:

Add support for different database types?
Add compression for the backup files?
Add backup verification?
Add a simple CLI interface with more options?
